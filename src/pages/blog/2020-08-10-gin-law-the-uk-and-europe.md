The European Union has the strictest laws governing gin, and these have been used as a, somewhat loose, model for gin regulations in other nations around the world. [These regulations](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008R0110&from=EN) were last updated in 2008, and the UK Wine Spirits and Trade Association have [put forth the concept for the creation of a category for “flavored gins”](https://www.wsta.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Post-Brexit-Reg-burden.pdf), once the UK have finished its transition period out of the EU and official left the bloc.

For now though, here’re the 3 types of gin that can currently be manufactured and sold under EU law in Europe and the UK. There’re is a regulated juniper flavored spirit but, not technically being a gin, that hasn’t been included here.

## Gin

The most basic of gins: 

Minimum 37.5% ABV.

Must be flavored with natural flavor substances or by synthesized or isolated substances, chemically identical to those natural substances, so that the flavor is predominantly juniper.

Produced by flavoring alcohol, of agricultural origin e.g. neutral grain spirit, with juniper berries, *juniperus communis*.

## Distilled Gin

* Minimum 37.5% ABV.

Distilled gin is defined thus:

Juniper flavored spirit drink produced by redistilling alcohol, of agricultural origin e.g. neutral grain spirit, with an initial ABV of at least 96% in a still traditionally used for gin, in the presence of juniper berries, *juniperus communis*, and other natural botanicals, provided the juniper flavor is predominant.

Mixing the product of above distillation with alcohol of agricultural origin of the same composition -purity and alcoholic strength- and/or the flavor substances described for the above category of *gin*.

Note: The first part is a necessary element of the second. Therefore *distilled gin* has to have some element of natural plant material distilled in it. Notice also that the guidelines do not say in which ratios these two parts need to be mixed. It is also not required that the complete both steps, completing the first is enough to qualify as *distilled gin*.

## London Gin

London gin is a type of distilled gin. It has many more regulations than distilled gin regarding it’s makeup but the basic gist of London gin is as follows:

Minimum 37.5% ABV.

Made with alcohol of agricultural origin, containing no more than 5g of methanol per 100 liters of 100% ABV.

Flavored through the re-distillation of the above spirit in the presence of all natural plant material.

Resulting distillate should be no less than 70% ABV.

Any alcohol added should meet the criteria in bullet point 2.

No added sweetening exceeding 0.1g of sugar per liter for the final product.

No colorants added.

Only water may be added to this, nothing else.

*Note:* The term *London gin* can be supplemented by the term *dry*. This means that *London dry gin* and *London gin* are, in the eyes of the law, the same product.

All gins produced from outside of Europe and the UK that wish to appear in these markets need to fit the requirements of the above categories to use these terms on their labels. Whilst a spirit may fit the regulations of *distilled gin* in a gin’s home nation it might not meet the regulations for it in the EU, therefore it must either change for the European market or downgrade itself to just *Gin*; if it fulfills those requirements.

## A Future Flavored Gin?

Gin laws in the UK are still currently bound to those defined by the EU. This is until after the transition period and the UK has officially broken ties with the EU, currently the end of 2020. As aforementioned, the UK Wine Spirits and Trade Association has put forth the idea that the UK government should introduce the category of *flavored gin* to the market. Their suggested definition is:

A *distilled gin*, see above definition, with a predominant flavor other than juniper.

Minimum 37.5% ABV.

Can be sweetened, blended, matured, or colored.

When sweetened, must contain less that 100g of sweetener per liter.

May be sold under the name of any predominant flavor, along with the words *distilled gin*.

The only flavoring ingredients to be used are natural flavorings or food ingredients with flavoring properties.
