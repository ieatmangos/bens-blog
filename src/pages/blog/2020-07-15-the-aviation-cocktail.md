With its pale blue to pale purple hue the aviation must sure have been a head turner when it was being made by bartenders in New York in the early 1900’s. Considered a variation of the gin sour and having been invented, bastardized, seemingly dropped out of the cocktail cannon, and then revered as a lost-classic the aviation found a new heyday just over a decade ago when cocktail geeks and historians managed to get their hands on what had become an elusive ingredient; crème de violette.

There’re 4 different recipes on this page, the reader may make them all and choose which he or she prefers and there’re also notes at the end, if one wishes to skip the history, pertaining to choosing your ingredients wisely.

## History Part 1: Invention and First Publication

The aviation recipe first appeared in print in the 1916 book *Recipes for Mixed Drinks* by German-born, Hugo R. Ensslin, head bartender of Time Square’s Hotel Wallick. Many attribute the drink’s creation to him however this fact is unknown because in the introduction to his book he states:

> “The object of this book is to give a complete list of the standard mixed

> drinks that are in use at present in New York City”

*Recipes for Mixed Drinks* was one of the last cocktail books to be printed before the beginning of prohibition and, as such, was lost between those which came before it and those that came after prohibition. Here is Hugo Ensslin’s original recipe:

AVIATION COCKTAIL

⅓ (¾oz) Lemon Juice

⅔ (1½oz) El Bart Gin

2 Dashes Maraschino

2 Dashes Crème de Violette

Shake well in a mixing glass with cracked ice, strain and serve.

**Note:** El Bart Gin was a pure, fragrant, and dry gin, unsweetened and clean, due to its grain base. It’s no longer in production but David T. Smith wrote an excellent [discovery piece](https://distilling.com/distillermagazine/come-fly-with-me-or-the-story-of-the-first-aviations-gin/) on it in 2017.

## History Part 2: Bastardization

Harry Craddock published the first edition of the now infamous *Savoy Cocktail Book* in 1930, containing 750 recipe. Amongst these was a recipe for the Aviation Cocktail. But Mr Craddock omitted an ingredient essential to this cocktail’s color and name, the crème de violette!

AVIATION COCKTAIL

⅓(¾oz) Lemon Juice

⅔ (1½oz) Dry Gin

2 Dashes Maraschino

Shake well and strain into cocktail glass.

He took out the crème de violette and didn’t replace it, making this quite a tangy cocktail, why?

Many have speculated that it was because crème de violette was scarce, however Craddock uses it in the cocktail listed directly above the Aviation Cocktail, the Atty Cocktail. This mystery remains unsolved but it may be down to the fact that the Savoy is in London and tastes are different on either side of the Atlantic.

## History Part 3: The Lost-Classic, it’s Revival and Re-Demise

During the beginning of the cocktail renaissance in the USA, considered to be sometime in the 1990’s, the original recipe for the Aviation Cocktail by Hugo R. Ensslin was uncovered and revered as a lost-classic. In their excitement cocktail geeks began trying to find crème de violette, but alas their search was in vain; crème de violette was very, *very* hard to find.

For those that could find this fabled liqueur their tastebuds were surely overjoyed and their minds swimming in glee to be tasting the original version of the classic Aviation Cocktail. It has been referred to as being a “bartenders handshake” at the beginning of the cocktail renaissance and saw itself a good comeback being ordered up, down, and across the country as bartenders rediscovered gin as the base for excellent white spirit cocktails.

Sadly, however, after a decade of popularity, taste for this drink has waned and it seems to have reclaimed its former title of lost-classic, with many bars no longer carrying two key components, maraschino liqueur and crème de violette, of this classic cocktail.

\##A Final Say…##

The author of this website is sad to see the demise of the original aviation cocktail, for it is one of his favorite gin drinks. So he will not leave it be without leaving you his own favorite version of the recipe and some notes on choosing ingredients; for, when making a cocktail with such few ingredients, each choice will decidedly affect the outcome of the drink.

The author’s preferred Aviation Cocktail:

2oz Aviation Gin

0.5oz Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice

1 Barspoon Maraschino Liqueur

1 Barspoon Crème Yvette

0.25oz Simple Syrup

Shake hard and strain into a chilled glass.

**The Gin -** The backbone of this cocktail and it needs to integrate well with the other ingredients. For the Aviation Cocktail this you’re going to want either a Dry Gin, or a slightly floral, botanical gin such as Bombay Sapphire. New West gins, often called American, are also excellent for this cocktail. As mentioned above this authors preferred gin for this cocktail is Aviation. This gin was designed to be the perfect gin for classic gin cocktails like the aviation cocktail and the Last Word; and it does a great job in its namesake cocktail.

**The Lemon Juice -** Alway’s fresh squeezed. If you can, don’t settle for anything less.

**The Crème -** There’re a few brands of crème de violette out there now and the choice is really going to be what’s available wherever you are. There’s one alternative to crème de violette and that is Crème Yvette. Crème Yvette, used in the authors preferred aviation cocktail, contains not only violet but also a variety of berries along with vanilla, honey, and orange peel. As a result it is more full bodied and sweeter than crème de violette and recipes will need adjusting if substituting.

**The Maraschino -** Luxardo’s is the universally preferred maraschino liqueur, due to the fact that it was the OG and really the only brand available around the turn of the 20th century when classic cocktails containing it began to appear. There’re now many other brands and if you’re in a pinch and don’t have maraschino you can swap out for a kirshwasser, a clear brandy distilled from cherries, who’s flavor profile is similar to that of maraschino. You can also you Cherry Heering, a cherry brandy, or other “cherry liqueurs” although these might be notably sweeter than maraschino and you’ll want to adjust your measures.

**A Garnish? -** There is no garnish for the Aviation Cocktail however some have taken to garnishing it with a brandied cherry. If you’re really looking to impress you can garnish it with a violet flower, but beware, the viola family has many lookalikes which aren’t edible and can be poisonous!
