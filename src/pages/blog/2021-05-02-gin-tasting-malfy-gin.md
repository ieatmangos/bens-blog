**Brand:** Malfy\
**Style:** Dry Gin

**ABV:** 41%

**Origin:** Italy



Gin is a beverage associated with many countries in Europe; but not Italy. Even stranger than an excellent Italian gin might be the claim on the back of the bottle that “Gin was invented in the Year 1050AD by Monks on the AMALFI Coastline”. A tall claim considering the more widely dispersed narratives of gin’s history.



Either way this excellently fruity gin is a great choice of gin and the bottle -as it’s designed to- brings forth dreams and memories of time spent in the sunshine!



Tasting



**Aroma:** Juicy lemon and mandarine notes accompany light, piney juniper tones. An ever so slight earthiness lingers in the background as lusciously full bodied citrus notes try to invade your palate by way of your nasal cavity.



**Flavor:** Soft and floral with a citrus drive. The mouthfeel is full, and earthy undertones slip in underneath the citrus, buoying them through to the end of the tasting experience, where light notes of juniper enter alongside notes of coriander to give this gin a crisp, dry finish.



**Botanicals:** local juniper, local lemon peel, coriander, cassia bark, iris root, angelica root



As bright and dry gin it does not at all disappoint the palate or the drinker. A slightly higher than average ABV really helps to bring out the brightness of the select citrus botanicals. The juniper is light yet present and this gin seems to sparkle on the palate; maybe that’s the MonViso mountain water they use to make it.



Cocktails



This gin, with how bright and zesty it is, would work excellently in a negroni, really playing well off the garnish and the bitter Campari. It works really well in a Corpse Reviver No. 2 and, predictably, makes a great G&T. Throw a few dashes of Angostura bitters into your G&T, to make it a pink gin, and garnish with a large lemon wheel to really reap the benefits of what this gin offers.







Fun Facts



* The bottle says gluten free but their website says it is made from Italian winter wheat spirit. So… be wary of this claim if you are one who finds that they still have adverse effects from spirits distilled from glutenous grains.
* They claim Monks were distilling gin on this part of the Italian coast in 1050AD, long before the dutch laid claim to genever. They were doing this, as many would expect, for medicinal purposes.
* They even suggest that the name gin comes from the Italian for juniper “ginepro”
* The lemons used are the same ones used to make limoncello
* The top of the cork is made from Italian oak
* This family, which has been producing this gin since 1901, has three flavored gins on the market: “Gin Rosa”, “Con Limone”, and “Con Arancia”
