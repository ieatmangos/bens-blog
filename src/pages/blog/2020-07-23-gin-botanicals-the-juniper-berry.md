Juniper is the flavor that defines gin and, in much of the world, gin can’t legally be called gin without a prominent juniper note in its flavor profile. This juniper flavor comes, simply, from the juniper berry which comes from… the juniper tree! Knowing juniper is essential to understanding gin, its flavor profile, and how to work with it behind the bar.

The medicinal benefits of the juniper berry are the reason why it was first added to distilled spirits, with the spirit extracting the flavors and, more importantly, the believed medicinal quality from the berries. This made it easier for people to consume and to mix with tinctures of other plant material believed to have medicinal benefits.

##Juniper and The Word Gin##

Gin comes from the Dutch word jenever -also genever- derived from the French word genevre, which is an altered version of the Latin word juniperus, which, in turn, is the word for juniper; both the tree and the berries. So the most prominent ingredient and flavor in gin is also it’s namesake!

##The Juniper Tree##


Juniper is a genus of coniferous, evergreen tree and shrub -called juniperus- consisting of between 50 and 67 species depending on who’s classifications you follow. Juniper plants vary greatly, from low sprawling shrubs to trees reaching over 130ft in height.

Juniper is widely distributed across the the Northern Hemisphere, from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and the Arctic, to the Mediterranean coast, Central America, and Northern Africa, to Pakistan, Japan, Tibet, and the Northern Himalayas where juniper trees create one fo the highest tree-lines in the world at 14,000ft!

As the above list shows, juniper is a hardy plant, thriving a wide variety of environments from dry, rocky, desert-like areas to tropical regions of the world. Juniper likes to live in open, uncrowded areas where it has plenty of access to rainfall, and it builds extended root systems to capture this rainfall. As individuals they compete with each other a lot, resulting in decreased berry production.

##The Juniper Berry##

Juniper plants have seeds but no flowers or fruit, and the berry, as we call it, is not actually a berry but a fleshy, berry-like, cone. Juniper berries are mostly blue to purple in color but there’re some species that have developed a red-brown or orange color. Juniper, interestingly, is the only known spice to be derived from conifer trees.

Not all juniper berries are edible, some are considered too bitter, whilst the berries of some juniper trees are poisonous. The berries start out green then mature over 18 months changing to their signature blue color.

##Flavors of The Juniper Berry##

As the backbone of gin’s flavor profile juniper berries give gin a piney, often resinous, note. This note assists in gin’s naturally dry and almost refreshing mouthfeel. Young juniper berries are full of pinene -also heavily present in turpentine- the compound which provides these signature piney, resinous flavors. 

As the berries mature they develop greener, and more citrusy notes and some gin experts say that when these flavors are sensed in gin it’s not other botanicals that supply this flavor -lime and lemon peels are botanicals almost as omnipresent in gin as juniper- but this element of the juniper berry’s chemical makeup. 

##Using Juniper in Gin##

Like most botanicals, the flavors of the juniper berry are strongest and freshest when picked and they quickly degrade over time. Due to the proximity of juniper trees to gin distilleries juniper berries are almost always dried after picking and then shipped to the distilleries. whether dry or fresh the juniper berries are usually cracked before being put into the still and this helps to release the aroma and flavor compounds locked within. Botanicals are usually macerated in grain spirit for 24 to 48 hours, yet there are some who believe that maceration “stews” the flavors and these folk prefer to add the botanicals and distill immediately.

The juniper berries used in gin typically come from the juniper communis tree, the woody plant with the largest geographical range in the world, found across North America, Europe, Asia, and, in ancient form, in Northern Africa. There’re some distillers in the United States, however, who are using using edible berries from the other juniper trees found on the continent of North America. These are said to have sweeter, less piney and resinous flavor and aroma notes.

##The Medicinal Benefits of Juniper Berries##

Thanks to junipers longterm use in the world of aromatherapy and herbal medicine there is a lot of detail about the aromatic and chemical makeup of the juniper berry. This has helped distillers a whole bunch, but crucially this is the origin of gin. It began as a tincture, consumed for health purposes, before becoming consumed for pleasure and enjoyment like we do today. 

The greeks believed that juniper berries increased physical stamina, and Native Americans used juniper berries for female birth control, but these are old uses. In today’s world juniper, mainly in extract form, is used to treat stomach upset, gas, heartburn, bloating, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal infections, intestinal worms, urinary tract infections, bladder pains, joint and muscular pains, and open wounds. It is important to note that whilst some many push these benefits there is still not enough evidence to support these claims. Juniper is also used in aromatherapy, and is said to be calming.

##Juniper in Cooking##

Juniper berries are used mainly in Northern European and Nordic foods, however it is the signifying spice used in Tyrolean Speck, a cured ham from Northern Italy which has been around since at least the 1200’s. It is used mainly with gamey meats, like boar, venison, rabbit, and duck, and is sometimes used to season the meat but is more often used to season the accompanying cream or tomato based sauce. It has also been used in sweet dishes like fruitcake.
