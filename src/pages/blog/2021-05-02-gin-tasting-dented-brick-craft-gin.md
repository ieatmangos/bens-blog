**Brand:** Dented Brick Craft Gin\
**Style:** Gin

**ABV:** 40%

**Origin:** Salt Lake City, Utah, USA



This is an easy drinking gin that is light and very good for someone who insists they don’t like gin because all they’ve drunk previously are London Dry, juniper bombs. This gin is produced using mountain snowmelt water which has been filtered through limestone and is drawn from an artisan well on top of which the distillery is built. Cheap and cheerful this is a gin for everyone!



Tasting



**Aroma:** Bright juniper dives out at the sniffer, helped along by pungent notes of wintergreen which give this gin a medicinal-esque aroma. Underneath lie notes of earth and cardamom. Overall, a refreshing sniff.



**Flavor:** Upfront there is an ever so slight sweetness, but notes of lemon and juniper quickly jump forth giving this gin a clipped crispness. There’re slight sense of fruity-ness which lingers for the duration of the sip. Light bodied with a medium finish.



**Botanicals:** Juniper, coriander, fennel, citrus peel, and angelica root



Whilst this gin is nothing outrageously special it is still a very decent gin. A light snappy gin that doesn’t assault the palate and is a great starter gin for those who aren’t looking for the juniper assault of so many other gins.



Cocktails



As a light, indistinct gin this gin works excellently in most cocktails. It makes a very refreshing and pound-able gin and tonic, whilst also working very well in Dick Brandsell’s Bramble!



Fun Facts



* The water used to produce this gin comes from the slopes of the mountains of Utah. It is filtered through a bed of limestone and ends up in the artisan well used by Dented Brick.
* The digger who created this artisan well was killed in a “blazing gunfight” in his home. A fight which made its mark, by denting them, on some of the bricks of his house.
* The Dented Brick name come from these bricks, some of which were used in the building of the distillery, paying homage to the digger and giving the distillery its name.
