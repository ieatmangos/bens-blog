Gin is defined differently across the world with different government and regulatory bodies choosing to define the product in their own way. All governments, however, necessitate the presence of the flavor of juniper berries, whether it be the predominant flavor or whether the spirit just has the characteristics of juniper berries. It is worth noting that in order to be sold as “Gin” in a certain country or region of the world that the product must meet the requirements of that country or region, not just the requirements of the place it was produced. Follow the links below to find out how gin is defined in different countries and regions of the world.
