Gin has a _loooong_ history, beginning life as a Dutch spirit called jenever, a.k.a genever, which arose from the tempering of the harsh spirit of the day with botanicals that were considered medicinal; especially juniper berries. From here it travelled to England through war and evolved into what we today call gin, gaining the nicknames “Dutch Courage” and “Mother Ruin” as it spread throughout Europe, specifically the UK.
