Today, tonic water is a carbonated beverage who’s predominant, and often only, flavor is quinine. Tonic water was originally used as preventative medicine, against malaria, and originates from the 19th century, when British colonialists in India began recommending its use to their soldiers for this purpose; hence the use of the name tonic.



How Did We Get The Gin and Tonic?



Whilst the rest of the British Navy were given rum rations the Officers were given gin rations. Quinine is bitter and unpalatable, so it was typically mixed with carbonated water and sugar, to make “taking your medicine” more palatable. Some one then had the even better idea of combining this with their gin ration and, voila, we have the gin and tonic! Members of the British Navy were also given a lime ration, to prevent scurvy, and this was inevitably thrown into the mix creating what we today know to be a classic G&T!



Medicinal Tonic Water vs Today’s Tonic Water



It is very good to note that, whilst, like me, you might sip your gin and tonic under the veil of good health, even if you, also like me, live somewhere where your chances of catching malaria are much greater than those of being struck by lightening and winning the lottery in the same evening, the quantity of quinine required to have the desired medicinal effects far exceeds the amount you’ll find in any tonic water’s available on the market. So if you think your tonic water is bitter, then imagine drinking your “tonic” in 19th century colonial India!



What is Quinine?



Quinine is sourced from the bark of the Chincona tree. These trees are native to Peru and were originally used by the Quechua people -natives of the South American Continent, whose most well known peoples are the Inca- who ground the bark of the tree to stop shivering. They also mixed it with sweetened water to counteract the bitter taste.



The Quechua people introduced this medicinal bark to Spanish Jesuit missionaries who, in turn sent a sample to Europe where malaria was a huge problem, especially in the religious capital of Rome. From here it then became known as Jesuit bark or Peruvian bark.



In 1820 two French researchers isolated quinine from the bark and named it thus, deriving the name quinine from what the Inca people called the tree, *quina*.



Despite first being sourced from Chincona trees, very little of the tonic found in today’s tonic water comes from these trees. Another genus of plant, *Remijia*, contains 0.5-2% quinine and has a much more intense taste, it is these plants which now provide the world with the majority of quinine needed for tonic water.



Why is my Tonic Water Glowing?



The quinine in tonic fluoresces under blacklight. It absorbs the shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet light, which we can’t see, and emits light in the part of the spectrum which our eyes can detect; thus it glows! Quinine is so good at this the effect is visible during the day if the tonic is held i direct sunlight and viewed against a dark background.



What Other Flavors are in Tonic Water?



Sugar, first and foremost, because even the comparably minute amounts quinine now dissolved in tonic water make this a very, *very* bitter beverage. The two most popular mass-market brands use high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener, and it is this which many gin aficionados say gives people the bad hangovers they usually blame on gin. New more boutique brands of tonic water use real sugar or a sweetener alternative.



Citrus is the second most common flavor addition to tonic water with both lime and lemon being used. Other citrus flavors are only found in specialty flavors of tonic water.



Besides these there’re few flavorings added to tonic water. That is, however, until you begin to look into the wide variety of flavored tonics which have burst onto the market over the past decade.



Which is The Best Tonic Water for My Gin and Tonic?



Whichever is your favorite, is the best, get out of there quickly answer. But, really, everyones tastes are different. However, the flavors of gins vary, that’s why there’re so much variety in the world of gin when compared to other spirits!
