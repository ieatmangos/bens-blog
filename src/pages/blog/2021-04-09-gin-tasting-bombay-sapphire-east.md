**Brand:** Bombay Sapphire East

*** Style:*** London Dry Gin

***ABV:*** 42%

***Origin:*** England



The original Bombay Sapphire has here been adapted with the addition of Thai lemongrass and Vietnamese black peppercorn. This gin was created in tribute to Far East, where Bombay Sapphire’s Master of Botanicals, Ivano Tonutti, spent a lot of time sourcing exotic botanicals. Ivano himself created this gin.

Sticking to the Bombay Sapphire tradition this gin is also vapor infused, and the addition of these two extra botanicals brings the total amount of botanicals in this gin to 12. These additions really do compliment and -dare we say it- improve on the original product. This gin was first test marketed in Las Vegas and New York in 2011 before being launched across the USA.

Tasting

***Aroma:*** Notes of lemongrass and the spice of black pepper leap forth from this drink, before being joined by the distinctively piney notes of juniper berries. 

***Flavor:*** On the palate this gin is light and succulent, bringing forth vivid notes of lemongrass, backed up by coriander and an ever so slight earthiness. The Juniper is not overly present on the palate, but this soft gin finishes with a bright, spicy kick of black pepper.

***Botanicals:*** Lemongrass, black pepper, juniper berries, grains of paradise, lemon peel, cubeb berries, coriander (seeds), cassia bark, angelica root, almonds, orris, licorice  

This is an excellent addition to the Bombay Sapphire range, and one which seems to be here to stay for at least a while. Light, floral, with just the right amount of spice this is a smooth and easy drinking gin, with an ABV that allows the flavors of all the botanicals to dance on the tongue without being too overpowering for the regular gin drinker.

Cocktails

This is, in fact, an excellent gin for sipping neat, or poured over a large ice cube, whichever way you are inclined.

The Bee’s Knees is an excellent cocktail to help the showcase botanicals in this gin shine! Garnish it with a little cracked black pepper to help eek the pepper notes even further out of the gin.

On a completely different vein the gin in this bottle is great in a filthy martini! Whilst it might be on the lighter side the ABV and body of the base spirit help left the botanicals up to compete alongside the briny nature of the olive brine. That being said, it works well in a classic martini -stirred so as not to disturb the delicate botanicals too much- when paired with a lighter vermouth that suits the lighter style of the botanical infusion.


Fun Facts

There’re not many exceptional facts about this well crafted take on the world renown Bombay Sapphire gin.

The only one which stands out is that this gin was designed by the gentleman, Ivano Tonutti, responsible for sourcing and holding to standard all of the botanicals used by the Bacardi drinks group. He had selected the botanicals and helped in the production of this product so all we have to say is: “Hats off to you Sir on a job well done!”
