Gin is essentially excellently and uniquely flavored vodka. To make gin one must first make neutral grain spirit i.e. spirit distilled to a high, flavorless, level. Then you redistill that neutral grain spirit with botanicals -with juniper being the omnipresent flavor- to produce gin. However, not all gins are created equal and thereâ€™re different methods you can use to incorporate the flavors of botanicals into your neutral grain spirit.
