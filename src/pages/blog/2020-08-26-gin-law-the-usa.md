Gin law in the USA is much simpler than that of the [UK and European Union](https://bens-gin.netlify.app/blog/2020-08-10-gin-law-the-uk-and-europe/), containing just one paragraph in their law page which defines gin as a [“Class” of distilled spirit](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/5.35), where this class tells the consumer of the “general character of the product”. Gin has two distinct definitions in this paragraph. Confusing to decipher but also, seemingly, straightforward; aren’t all laws once you’ve read them enough times. 

\## Gin

* Bottled at no less than 80º proof (40%ABV)
* Must derive its main characteristic flavor from juniper berries
* Produced by macerating juniper berries and other “aromatics”, or extracts derived from these materials, with “neutral spirit” or “alcohol”

\## Distilled Gin

* Bottled at no less than 80º proof (40%ABV)
* Must derive its main characteristic flavor from juniper berries
* Produced by distilling juniper berries and other aromatics, or extracts derived from these materials, with either a mash or the product of that mash, which is called “neutral spirit”or “alcohol”.

Furthermore, products produced using the *distilled gin* method talked about above, may also be known as “Dry gin (London dry gin)”, “Geneva gin (Holland gin), and “Old Tom gin (Tom gin)”. There is quite a bit of freedom of interpretation for American distillers in this legal text, and whilst some do keep close to the EU style regulations, such freedom has allowed for the creation of a new style, per-say, of gins; designated New World, or American gins.

There is also a class of flavored gins -grouped in with all other flavored spirits in the law- and these are defined as thus.

\## Flavored Gin

* Bottled at no less than 60º proof (30%ABV)
* Using the originally defined spirit above as a base, you may add natural flavoring materials, with or with out the addition of sugar.
* The name of the predominant flavor, i.e. the natural flavor added, shall appear as part of the name (or “designation” as it is called).
* If the final product contains more than 2.5% volume of wine, the quantities and kinds of wine must be used as part of the name.

**Note:** A mash is a mix of fermented beer and the spent grain used to make it; think of beer before it has been drawn off the grain so that it can be be boiled and have the hops added. This must be distilled to or above 190º proof, then it is legally defined as, “neutral spirit” or “alcohol”.
