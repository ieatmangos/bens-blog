**Brand:** Gordon’s Style:  London Dry Gin
**ABV:** 40% (US market standard)
**Origin:** London (Although this bottling is from Norwalk, Connecticut)

A -some would say _the_- classic London Dry Gin, Gordon’s was created in 1769 by Alexander Gordon, a Londoner descended from Scotts.  Gordon’s London Dry Gin is now distilled around the world and is the world’s best selling gin. It uses 100% grain neutral spirit, and was first distilled in Southwark, London, with the original recipe used by Alexander back then still being, impressively, the recipe used today. It was originally called Gordon’s Special London Dry Gin.

## Tasting ##

**Aroma:** Juniper forward but not overpoweringly resinous, a slight soapy lemon citrus blends well with the juniper notes, followed by ever so slight earthy undertone. Crisp and light. 

**Flavor:** Sweet citrus followed quickly by a medium juniper note which is crisp, light to medium bodied, soft, and almost fruity in nature. Medium finish which brings in a definite earthy element. 

**Botanicals:** The bill is secret but it is said to contain: juniper, coriander, lemon peel, and angelica root. Other mentioned botanicals are orange peel, liquorice, and orris root.  

Overall an excellent and classic benchmark for all aspiring London Dry Gins. At first it seems simple yet the more you drink the more it opens out in terms of complexity.

## Cocktails ##

Like most classic London Dry Gins it is no surprise that Gordon’s slips excellently into many classic gin cocktails. In fact, one can assume that Gordon’s might’ve been the gin used in the original preparations of these cocktails given its longstanding, worldwide popularity.

Gordon’s gin makes for an excellent G&T, a great dry martini, works fantastically in a gimlet and makes a damn good John Collins. When working with other ingredients which bring out the light, slightly citrusy, not overly complex elements of a gin Gordon’s London Dry Gin definitely shines!

## Fun Facts ##

The boar’s head found emblazoning every bottle of Gordon’s gin is there because, according to legend, a member of the House of Gordon, or Gordon Clan, saved the King of Scotland from a boar while out hunting. Ever since the Gin has featured the head of the animal on its bottles.
