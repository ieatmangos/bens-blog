**Brand:** Roku Gin\
**Style:** Japanese

**ABV:** 43%

**Origin:** Japan


Roku, meaning six in Japanese, is sold in a six sided bottle that is as eye catchingly elegant as it seems rugged. On top of a base of eight classic gin botanicals Roku gin uses six unique Japanese botanicals, selected to represent the best of the growing regions of Japan, and harvested at the peak of the season to bring all four seasons into this balanced gin.
Japanese culture is known for its attention to detail and Japanese distillers are no different, with each botanical in this delicate gin being distilled separately, with some botanicals using unique distillation methods to coax the best out of them.



### Tasting

**Aroma:** The quintessential gin aroma of juniper is there to greet the drinker, followed by light notes of citrus. This then chased out by the Japanese botanicals as lingering green tea scents and a clean spiciness take over. There is a sweet profile to this gin and the final fragrance is reminiscent of vanilla.

**Flavor:** This is a delicate gin, whose floral notes come through at the beginning with a well bodied sweetness. As is on the nose, the middle of the palate finds note of citrus, which are overtaken by a unique spiciness which helps this gin fade off the palate.

**Botanicals:** Juniper, coriander seed, angelica root, angelica seed, cardamom, cinnamon, bitter orange, lemon peel, sakura flower (cherry blossom), sakura leaf (cherry tree lead), sencha tea (green tea), gyokuro tea (refined green tea), sanshō pepper, yuzu peel





A unique and excellently produced gin whose floral elegance and notes of spice open up a new spectrum of the world of gins for any drinker. If you’re looking for something from the spectrum of Japanese gin that is highly unique yet still familiar then Roku is definitely the crowd pleaser you’re after.



### Cocktails



Firstly, it has to be said, that with its use of unique botanicals, and the fact that this is an overall high quality product, Roku is an excellent sipping gin; best severed neat at room temperature or poured from the fridge.



As a great sipping gin Roku also makes an excellent martini, especially an extra dry one. If using it in any martini variation requiring vermouth choose a floral, not too over overpowering vermouth, such as Dolin. Despite this gin’s delicacy the spicy finish ensures that it conducts itself excellently in a dirty martini.



When used in a gin and tonic the spicy finish of Roku adds the cocktails refreshingly, dry and zippy finish. Suntory, the producers of Roku gin, recommend thin strips of ginger as a garnish with this gin. In the spirit of omotenashi -a Japanese hospitality term epitomized in [the tea ceremony](http://japanese-tea-ceremony.net/), meaning to whole heartedly look after guests, - Roku have [detailed the perfect serve of a Roku G&T](https://rokugin.suntory.com/en/global/gin-cocktail-recipes) that exemplifies Japanese hospitality.

* Roku gin is available at a strength of 47%ABV, but, sadly, only in Japan.

* To extract the best of the flavors from the cherry blossom distillers use the rarely used method of vacuum distillation.
