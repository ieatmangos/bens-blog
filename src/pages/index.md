  title: What is Gin Made From?
  description: Gin is essentially excellently and uniquely flavored vodka. To make
    gin one must first make neutral grain spirit i.e. spirit distilled to a
    high, flavorless, level. Then you redistill that neutral grain spirit with
    botanicals -with juniper being the omnipresent flavor- to produce gin.
    However, not all gins are created equal and there’re different methods you
    can use to incorporate the flavors of botanicals into your neutral grain
    spirit. Click here to learn all about how gin is made.

  description: >-
    In the EU, as in many other regions and countries of the world, there’re
    legal definitions of gin which producers and other products must adhere to
    in order to label their product as gin. The EU regulations are the strictest
    such definitions for gin in the world and they form the basis of all gin
    regulations around the world. There’re many types of gin out there but the
    synopsis of the most common types of gin are as follows:


    **Compound Gin (or Juniper Flavored Spirit Drink) -** Generally considered the lowest quality gin these product need only have flavors, natural or artificial, added to alcohol used to secure their status. No re-distillation required. Minimum 30% ABV


    **Gin -** A juniper flavored spirit made use only natural, or naturally derived flavors. Minimum 37.5% ABV


    ** Distilled Gin -** Pure, 96% alcohol spirit, must be redistilled in still predominantly used for gin with juniper berries and other natural botanicals. Minimum 37.5%ABV


    **London Gin (or Dry Gin) -** A gin produced to the highest standards set by the EU. On a basic level it requires the re-distillation of neutral grain sprit with _only_ natural plant material in traditional stills. These can also be called _Dry_ or _London Dry_ Minimum 37.5% ABV.


    It should be noted that it is required that juniper berries be used in their natural form, or specified natural derivative of the berry, in all of the above styles; even compound gin. There’re many other type and styles of gin out there including: sloe gin, American gin, Japanese gin, Old Tom gin, and, of course, not forgetting genever (jenever), the grandfather of modern gin. Read more about what makes each type of these gins unique right here.
